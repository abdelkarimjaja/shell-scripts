Emacs is not merely a text editor but almost a complete operating system. 

Emacs helps you be productive by providing an integrated environment for many
different kinds of tasks:

 >> All of the basic editing commands (and there are lots of them) are available no
matter what you're trying to do: write code, read a manual, use a shell, or
compose an email.
 >> All the tools Emacs provides for opening, saving, searching, and processing text
(and more) are available to you no matter what you're doing.j

general keys:

C- : means use the CTRL key.
M- : means use the Meta(Alt) Key.

a buffer in Emacs is a workspace where you can edit and manipulate text or data,
whether it's associated with a file on disk or used for temporary work.
Emacs is designed to handle a large number of buffers

C-x C-f : open a file from within Emacs.
C-x C-s : save a file.
