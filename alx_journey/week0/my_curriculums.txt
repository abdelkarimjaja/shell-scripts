Curriculum SE Foundations - Overview
:-----------------:-----------------:
The primary focus of Foundations is to achieve mastery of fundamental
engineering concepts and become skilled in coding. Professional Development will
be a key supplement of this primary goal. At the conclusion of Foundations,
students will have acquired a strong foundation of technical knowledge from
which they can either build upon with a Specialization or begin preparing for
interviews and jobs as part of Holberton’s interview prep, Career Sprint. For
more information, please expand the information in the Overview
